# acschweizer.github.io
# My name is Aiden Schweizer and my email is acschweizer@my.waketech.edu
# My GitHub account is empty and a fresh slate. I've never used this app before so there is nothing there
# My repository is the same way, but will have all of this info when I am done with it! So neither will be empty for long!
# The steps I took to clone this repository were to get Github, create a repository to clone, use the clone button and select a folder to place the copy in in File Explorer. In my case its on my SATA in a folder dedicated to GitHub, which I will eventually move to my CTI folder
